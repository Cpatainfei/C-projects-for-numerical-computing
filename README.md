# Codes for the scientific computing with numerical examples module during my time in UCC

This reporsitory contains all four course projects and a final exam submission, which are all written in C#.

The assignments cover the implementations of a series of automation, machine learning, and mathematical modeling problems, including a cellular automaton in Assignment 1, a sigle layer neural network (perceptron) in Assignment 2, the RungeKuta model implemented in Assignment 3, and the predator prey model implemented the final assessment with a bifurcation plot for the population change.

## Usage

Each fold contains the whole project with its .sln files derived from the MS vistual studio, while the source codes are extracted additionally in .cs files, which could be run directly.
